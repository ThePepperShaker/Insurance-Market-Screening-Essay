# Insurance-Market-Screening-Essay

I have always found it difficult to incorporate nice graphs into my Economics essays, so I thought R could possibly help me with this process. 
This essay relied heavily on graphs to explain the core concepts of screening in an insurance market and I found a tutorial on how to construct economics graphs in R by Andrew Hess (andrewheiss.com). 
I adapted that work to create my own graphs for this essay.
