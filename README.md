# Microeconomics Screening Essay 

This essay covers the situation of screening in insurance markets. My main goal for this essay was to create graphs in R so that i donâ€™t have to use Word to create graphs for Economics essays.
The topic of adverse selection in insurance markets was originally covered by Rotschild and Stiglitz (1976).
