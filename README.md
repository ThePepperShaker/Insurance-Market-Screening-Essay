# Microeconomics Screening Essay 

This essay covers the situation of screening in insurance markets. My main goal for this essay was to create graphs in R so that i donâ€™t have to use Word to create graphs for Economics essays. 

I adapted my work from the tutorial from andrewheiss.com showing how to create supply and demand graphs in R.
